/**
 * The family portal's "one thing to do next" band.
 *
 * The product already had this primitive twice — the admin's `/dashboard`
 * opens with a coal band carrying one figure, one sentence and one red CTA
 * ("12 · Pagos esperan tu validación · Revisar ahora"), and the trainer's
 * `/trainer` opens with the same shape ("18:00 · Sábado 18:00 — 20:00 · Pasar
 * lista"). The family portal was the only authenticated area that opened with
 * no such band at all: it led with the carnet, and the route to paying was an
 * underlined text link in the second card, sitting *below* two secondary
 * buttons that read far more like the page's action than it did.
 *
 * So this is not a new pattern. It is the product's own pattern, finally
 * applied to the screen whose reader has the most at stake in it, and it is
 * the answer to "no se indica bien cómo ir a hacer el pago, muy confuso":
 * whether anything is owed, what the plan costs, and the button, all above
 * the fold and one click from the action.
 *
 * ## Honesty rules this band inherits
 *
 * `describePaymentSituation` (student-utils.ts) owns every word and every
 * number here, and it cannot state an amount due because the backend has no
 * debt concept. The band therefore leads with a COUNTED figure — days of
 * coverage left, days overdue, or payments in review — never with a currency
 * amount, and the price line is labelled as a plan price. Red is spent only
 * on `urgent` states, so a family that is up to date is not shouted at.
