/**
 * HelpChatLauncher — a trigger that owns the assistant panel's open state.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `POST /chatbot/consultar` is public and unauthenticated, and the assistant
 * answers exactly the questions a prospective member has before they have an
 * account ("¿cuánto cuesta?", "¿qué horarios hay?", "¿cómo me inscribo?").
 * When `ChatWidget` moved from the root layout into `AppShell`, that whole
 * audience lost it: the panel only existed behind a sidebar that only exists
 * after login.
 *
 * Mounting it globally again is not the fix. The reason it left the layout was
 * its floating action button — `fixed bottom-5 right-5 z-40`, sitting over the
 * landing's WhatsApp block and over the trainer's attendance controls. So the
 * FAB does not come back. Instead each public surface gets a trigger that
 * belongs to its own composition:
 *
 *   · the landing's contact block, beside the WhatsApp button — the place a
 *     visitor already goes to ask something;
 *   · `AuthShell`'s small print, under the card, for /login, /forgot-password
 *     and /reset-password;
 *   · the enrolment wizard's header, where the questions are about the form
 *     being filled in.
 *
 * Since the floating launcher came back as `HelpChatDock`, this component no
 * longer mounts a panel of its own — it is a TRIGGER. It calls
 * `openHelpChat()` and the dock's single `ChatWidget` opens, which is what
 * keeps "the assistant" one thing: the same conversation, the same role-scoped
 * quick replies, and never two panels on one screen. The inline triggers stay
 * because they are where the question is actually asked (beside the WhatsApp
 * button, under the login form, in the wizard header) — the float is the
 * answer to "I could not find it", not a replacement for them.
