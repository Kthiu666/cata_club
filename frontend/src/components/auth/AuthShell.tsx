/**
 * AuthShell — the ONE template every public auth screen inherits.
 *
 * ## Which prototype is the authority
 *
 * `docs/ux/prototipo-rediseno.html` — the approved 14-view prototype, login
 * section at `<section class="stage" id="stage-login">`. `docs/ux/prototipos/`
 * supersedes it for the ADMIN shell, but NOT for these four screens: the small
 * `prototipos/01-login.html` composition is a different, reduced design, and
 * building against it is what produced the broken screen this file replaces.
 * Every number below is transcribed from the 14-view file (CSS at its lines
 * 226-243, login instance overrides at 789-814, phone rules at 416-417).
 *
 * ## The composition FILLS THE VIEWPORT — this overrides the prototype
 *
 * The prototype bounds `.auth` at `min-height:660px` and centres it as an
 * artboard on a deeper page field. That is what shipped first, and the product
 * owner rejected it on sight: *"por qué el login no ocupa toda la pantalla"*.
 * A user decision beats a prototype measurement, so the composition is now
 * edge-to-edge — no max-width, no outer padding, no frame (border, radius,
 * elevation) around it, because a full-bleed split has no artboard to frame.
 *
 * Everything the prototype established that was NOT objected to survives
 * verbatim: the 42px headline (30px on phones), the coal panel wider than the
 * form panel, the red eyebrow, the ringed logo, the inline figure row, the red
 * links.
 *
 * The two panels are NOT equal halves: `.auth .dark { flex:1.1 }` against
 * `.auth .light { flex:1 }`. The coal panel is the wider one, because it
 * carries the 42px headline that is the whole point of the screen. Rendering
 * that headline at half its size (21px) is what made the screen read as
 * broken; it is `font-size:42px; font-weight:800; letter-spacing:-1.5px;
 * line-height:1.12; max-width:15ch; text-wrap:balance`, dropping to 30px on
 * phones (line 417).
 *
 * ## Both halves are centred on ONE axis — the viewport's own middle
 *
 * The first full-viewport revision hung each half off its own leftover space,
 * and the product owner read the result as two unrelated compositions: *"el
 * login y la parte izquierda no están bien centradas, se ven desalineadas"*.
 * Measured at 1440x900 it was exactly that — the brand cluster centred at
 * y=414, the form card at y=398, neither on the page's 450 — with a 194px
 * hole between the subtitle and the closing hairline.
 *
 * Both panels now use the SAME three-row grid: `1fr / auto / 1fr`. The middle
 * row holds the one object that matters (brand cluster left, form card right)
 * and the two `1fr` rails are forced equal, so that object's centre lands on
 * the panel's exact vertical middle — 450 on both sides, whatever the edge
 * chrome weighs. `1fr` resolves to `minmax(auto, 1fr)`, so a rail that cannot
 * fit its own content stops flexing instead of clipping it: on a short
 * viewport the composition degrades to top-weighted rather than overflowing.
 *
 * Two moves pay for that on the coal side:
 *
 *   1. The figure row rejoins the centre cluster. It stays the same INLINE
 *      baseline row over a `--coal-3` hairline (`display:flex;
 *      align-items:baseline; gap:10px`) — a number and its caption on one
 *      line, never a stacked divider/number/caption — but as the cluster's
 *      closing tier it gives the centre real mass and deletes the hole.
 *   2. Only the copyright is left pinned to the floor, which makes the two
 *      rails near-identical in weight: a 20px link above, an 18px line below.
 *
 * A single soft radial behind the brand mark gives the dark field depth, so
 * the air around the logo reads as a lit stage rather than as unpainted space.
 * It is one authored moment, suppressed on phones where there is no air.
 *
 * ## Phones stack, they do not hide
 *
 * `@media (max-width:980px){ .auth{flex-direction:column} }` — the coal panel
 * moves ABOVE the form, it is not removed. (The other prototype hid it; this
 * one is the authority here.) So there is no separate compact brand block.
 *
 * ## The single figure is the club's age, not a student count
 *
 * The prototype draws "67 estudiantes inscritos". That exact figure CANNOT be
 * rendered honestly: no endpoint an UNAUTHENTICATED visitor can call returns a
 * student count — `GET /dashboard/stats` and `GET /membresias/estadisticas`
 * both sit behind `GestorPermisos(["ADMINISTRADOR"])`, so a public caller gets
 * a 401 before any handler runs. An earlier revision filled the slot from
 * `src/mocks/*.ts`, i.e. it showed an invented number to every visitor.
 *
 * What is rendered instead is `yearsSinceFounding()`, derived from
 * `FOUNDING_DATE` — the constant of record the landing has published since its
 * first release ("Fundado el 10 de octubre"). Public, verifiable, no backend,
 * cannot drift. Same slot, same inline `<b>` + `<small>` shape, honest number.
 *
 * No client-only APIs are used here, so this stays server-safe.
