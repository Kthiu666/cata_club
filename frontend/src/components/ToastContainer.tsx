/**
 * ToastContainer — presentational stack for `ToastProvider`'s live toasts.
 * Above `ConfirmDialog` (`z-50`) so a toast stays visible even while a confirm
 * dialog is open. Newest toast is prepended by `ToastContext`, so it renders
 * first (on top) in the stack. Each toast exposes a manual close button in
 * addition to its own auto-dismiss timer.
 *
 * ## What a toast has to make obvious
 *
 * Three signals, in the order they are read: an icon that says *which kind of
 * thing happened* before any word is parsed, a semibold first line naming the
 * outcome, and — when the caller supplied one — a lighter second line saying
 * what that means or what to do next. The icon is redundant with the fill
 * colour on purpose: colour alone is not a channel everyone receives.
 *
 * Both lines are painted in solid `currentColor`. On `.toast-success`'s
 * #15803D, pure white measures 5.01:1 and any dimming of it (85% → 4.09:1,
 * 90% → 4.38:1) drops the supporting line below AA, so the two tiers are
 * separated by weight and size instead of by opacity. The close glyph is a
 * non-text control, so it may sit at 80% — 3.81:1 on that same green, above
 * the 3:1 floor for UI components.
 *
 * Two things are deliberate here:
 *
 * 1. The container carries NO `aria-live`. Each toast already declares
 *    `role="alert"` or `role="status"`, which ARE live regions — a live
 *    container wrapping live children makes assistive technology announce the
 *    same message twice.
 * 2. It docks to the BOTTOM below `sm`. At `top-4 right-4 w-full max-w-sm` it
 *    spanned a 360px phone edge to edge and covered the shell topbar's "Menú"
 *    button and notification bell — the toast auto-dismisses, the blocked
 *    navigation did not.
