/**
 * Hold a mutation for a few seconds so "Deshacer" can still mean something.
 *
 * ## Why holding, and not reverting
 *
 * The roll call can undo a mark by putting the roster back, because nothing
 * has left the browser yet. A payment decision is not like that: approving
 * flips the payment's state, activates the membership, and hands a receipt to
 * a Celery worker that generates a PDF and mails it. "Undoing" that on the
 * server would not be an undo, it would be a compensating transaction with
 * visible side effects — a membership that blinked active, a receipt already
 * in someone's inbox for a payment now marked pending again.
 *
 * So the undo happens BEFORE the request: the UI moves immediately, the
 * request waits, and pressing "Deshacer" cancels a thing that never happened.
 * That is the only version of undo that is honest here.
 *
 * ## The two ways a held commit could be lost, and how neither happens
 *
 * 1. **A second decision arrives.** The pending one is flushed first, so the
 *    admin's decisions reach the server in the order they made them. One
 *    commit is ever in flight; there is no queue to reorder.
 * 2. **They navigate away or close the tab.** `flush` runs on unmount and on
 *    `pagehide`, so leaving the screen COMMITS rather than silently discards.
 *    Discarding would be the worse failure by far: the admin saw "Pago
 *    aprobado", and the only safe reading of walking away is that they meant
 *    it.
 *
 * A commit that fails after the window closed has no button left to attach an
 * error to, which is why `schedule` takes an `onError` — the caller reports it
 * where the admin can still see it and puts the row back.
